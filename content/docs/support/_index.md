## Get Support

Donations, tips, support—whatever you want to call it—fuel not only creators but also open-source projects and causes, enabling them to thrive. Crypto has a big part to play in this, as it makes contributions global and private. Anyone around the world can get involved and contribute to a cause they believe in, without fear of judgment. Shakesco is here to make it easy—for both crypto natives and the masses.

With our pre-built checkout, you can start receiving value by sharing a simple URL with your Shakesco Name Service at the end, e.g., <https://donate.shakesco.com/@shawnkimtai.sns>.
Or, if you want to build your own, just send ONE API call—yes, that's right, ONE—and start receiving value.

Let’s get started!

### How to Get Started

To get started, choose the type of service you want to use, set the amount you want to receive, and decide whether you want to enable private transactions.

All these details can be edited in your Shakesco app. Under the 'Transact' tab, navigate to 'Support'.

### Type of Service

You can choose from the following subdomains:

1. <https://donate.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>
2. <https://tip.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>
3. <https://pay.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>
4. <https://coffee.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>
5. <https://support.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>
6. <https://sponsor.shakesco.com/@your-shakesco-name-service-name>

### Amount and Privacy

Privacy depends on whether your Shakesco username is set to private or public. The amount refers to the preset values that will appear before users are redirected to checkout. Both settings can be edited under the 'Transact' tab in the 'Support' section.
