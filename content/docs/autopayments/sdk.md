Before getting started, please obtain your API keys from the [dashboard](https://users.shakesco.com/login) and deploy your Business Auto account through the [Shakespay app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shakespay-bitcoin-ethereum/id6478241603).

Refer to the [Integration](../../autopayments/integration#requesting-token) guide for instructions on parsing values. Additionally, visit the [Start](../../autopayments/start) section to ensure your auto-payment account is configured to process payments.

If you want to test out the system, just go [here.](#test)

## @shakesco/automation

This repository makes it easy for businesss to interact with their autopayment contract and enable automation!

Before intergrating please read this [short explanation on how the system works](../../autopayments/integration). It will help you understand how you may want to setup your auto-payments.

### Install

```shell {filename=cmd}
npm i @shakesco/automation
```

After installing:

```javascript {filename=index.js}
const { Automation, parseUnits } = require("@shakesco/automation");
```

### Test

{{< callout type="info" >}}
We fund your test delegate address automatically, so you don't need to enter an amount in testing mode.
{{< /callout >}}

Before getting started, send a test request to make sure everthing is okay.

#### Request test address

First, request a delegate address by entering your business smart wallet address (it's the same for both Ethereum and Polygon) along with your API key:

```javascript {filename="index.js"}
  const your_smart_wallet_address = "";

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(
    your_smart_wallet_address, 
    process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY,
    "11155111"
  );

  const requestAddress = await shakescocontract.testDelegateAddressBuss(); //request test address

  console.log(requestAddress);
  // {
  //   id: "1",
  //   test_delegate_address: "0x472ef8282b420396ad307cb89f542e60b1dec1a1",
  // }
```

#### Test Request

Then send a request:

```javascript {filename="index.js"}
  const address = ""; // Your test delegate address you requested above

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(
  address,
  process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY, 
  "11155111");

  const period = "86400" //1 day

  const requestUser = await shakescocontract.requestUser(
    "0x309E7d835ccE6E74BC72A2E523fa7f79FFC0d413", // parse this address 
    "", 
    period, 
    "", 
    false, 
    [], 
    []);//request user

  console.log(requestUser);//Requested user successfully
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Check if the request is sent to your Shakespay app. If you request business check on Business wallet side, if you request user, check on [Personal wallet side](https://x.com/shakespay/status/1820573879334576486).
{{< /callout >}}

### Live

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Visit [__Shakesco__](https://shakesco.com/pricing "Shakesco") to get fee rates and then get your api keys [here](https://users.shakesco.com).  
If you want to see the fee charged for every transaction, go [__here__](https://shakesco.com/charges "Shakesco")
{{< /callout >}}

#### Request user

Send request to user. Ask user for Shakespay card/ Business card address.

```javascript {filename=index.js}
  const address = /* Initialize your automation address. Can be found in your dashboard https://users.shakesco.com */

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(address, process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY, "1");

  const period = "604800" //1 week

  const amount = parseUnits("20", 18); //amount to request regularly

  const delegateAddress = /*Ask user/business for their Shakespay card/delegate/business card ONLY.*/;

  const requestUser = await shakescocontract.requestUser(delegateAddress, "", period, amount, false, [], []);//request user

  const requestBusiness = await shakescocontract.requestBusiness(delegateAddress,"", period, amount);//or request business

  console.log(requestUser);//Requested user successfully
  console.log(requestBusiness);//Requested business successfully
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Period should be in seconds. Amount should be in USD. Eg: "20" is in USD. Boolean values are returned as __STRINGS__
{{< /callout >}}

#### Request Split payment

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Read about split payments [__here__](../../autopayments/integration#split)
{{< /callout >}}

When you want to request split payment:

```javascript {filename=index.js}
  const address = /* Initialize your automation/Shakespay auto/business auto address. Can be found in your dashboard https://users.shakesco.com */

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(address, process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY, "1");

  const period = "604800" //1 week

  const mainAddress = /** Users Shakespay card/delegate/business card ONLY.*/

  const friends = ["", ""]; //request friend details. Shakespay card/delegate/business card ONLY.

  const friendsAmount = [parseUnits("10", 18), parseUnits("10", 18)];

  const mainamount = parseUnits("10", 18);

  const requestUser = await shakescocontract.requestUser(mainAddress, "", period, mainamount, true, friends, friendsAmount);//request user

  console.log(requestUser); //Requested user successfully (Returns for mainAddress only)

  //so check the rest, "friends".
  for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    const isrequested = await shakescocontract.isRequested(friends[i]);
    console.log(isrequested); // true / false
  }
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Amount should be in USD. Eg: "10" is in USD. Boolean values are returned as __STRINGS__
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You will be receiving USD 30. But it is split among 3 friends.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Request Tokens

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Get token addresses [__here__](../../autopayments/integration#requesting-token)
{{< /callout >}}

When you want to request a token:

```javascript {filename=index.js}
  const address = /* Initialize your automation address. Can be found in your dashboard https://users.shakesco.com */

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(address, process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY, "137");

  const period = "604800" //1 week

  const amount = parseUnits("20", 18); //amount to request regularly

  const delegateAddress = /*Ask user/business for their Shakespay card/delegate/business card ONLY.*/

  const tokenAddress = "" //Make sure it is checksummed

  const requestUser = await shakescocontract.requestUser(delegateAddress, tokenAddress, period, amount, false, [], []);//request user

  const requestBusiness = await shakescocontract.requestBusiness(delegateAddress, tokenAddress, period, amount);//or request business

  console.log(requestUser);//Requested user successfully
  console.log(requestBusiness);//Requested business successfully
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Amount should be in USD. Eg: "20" is in USD.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Check payment status

To check if user has made payment or not:

```javascript {filename=index.js}
  const address = /*Initialize your automation address*/

  let delegateAddress = /*Request user for their info: Shakespay card/delegate/business card address ONLY*/

  const shakescocontract = new Automation(address, process.env.SHAKESCOAPIKEY, "137");

  const requestUser = await shakescocontract.hasPaid(delegateAddress);
  console.log(requestUser); //"true"

```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Check the above step where you are offering your service. Otherwise you will offer service for free without knowing.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
For split auto-payment, service is only given to 'group leader'. So always query them alone, the rest will just return false.
{{< /callout >}}

We also don't offer daily automation. If your business requires daily automation [please reach out to us](https://shakesco.com/contact "Shakesco")!

ENJOY YOUR FINANCIAL FREEDOMüòÅ!!!
