# Payroll

Set up scheduled payments for your team with ease. Before you proceed, ensure that your team members have a Shakesco Auto Wallet. If they donâ€™t, kindly ask them to create one.

## Get Started

After opening your Business Card Wallet and returning to the home screen, navigate to the "Transact" tab. Youâ€™ll see several options. Under the "Business to Business" category, click "Team." A pop-up like the one below should appear:

<div
style="display: flex;">

  height="200">
</div>

Choose Ethereum or Polygon depending on the Card you selected when opening your Business Card Wallet.

### Team Member

After selecting the Business Card Wallet you want to access, the following options will appear:

<div
style="display: flex;">

  height="200">
</div>

Choose whether to pay an Employee or an Executive.

- For Ethereum, select the asset you wish to use for payment and proceed to select the payee.
- For Polygon, the options below will appear:

</div>

### Soulbound Tokens

Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) are digital collectibles that cannot be transferred once received. Think of them as on-chain proof that your team member is associated with your business. Even if they leave your organization, they can still prove they worked for your company.

- With NFTs: Send a collectible that will permanently remain in their wallet alongside the payment.
- Without NFTs: Only send the payment without issuing an SBT.

#### With NFTs

If you choose "With NFTs," youâ€™ll see the page below. Select the collectible you want to send, then proceed to schedule the payment.

</div>

#### Without NFTs

If you choose "Without NFTs," the page below will appear. Select the asset you wish to send, then proceed to schedule the payment period.

### Select Payee

Choose your team member by asking for their Email, ENS Name, or Shakesco Username (.sns). Alternatively, if theyâ€™re with you, simply scan their walletâ€™s Receive QR code.

### Choose Amount

Enter the amount you wish to send to your team member regularly. Note the [fee](https://shakesco.com/charges), which is charged for every successful transaction.

### Start and Intervals

Finally, select the date when you want payments to start. Payments will automatically begin on the selected date.

Next, choose the payment intervalâ€”whether weekly, monthly, or custom days.

Proceed with 2FA and enter your PIN.
