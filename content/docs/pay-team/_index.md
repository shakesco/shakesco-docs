## Payrolls

When running a business, you have to look for talent wherever it may beâ€”whether in America, Asia, Europe, or even Africa. A distributed team means dealing with different payment methods during payroll. You have to register with various banks, pay feesâ€”itâ€™s time you could have used to build your company.

If thatâ€™s not enough, you incur high fees when performing these transactions, and your team might complain they didnâ€™t get paid. And itâ€™s not even your faultâ€”itâ€™s just that it was a bank holiday. ðŸ¤¨

Shakesco offers a better solution. Deploy a smart contract to pay your team on a recurring basis.

Okay, thatâ€™s kinda nerdy.

Shakesco is offering something simpler. Open your Business Card account to pay your team, wherever they are in the world.

Even better, you donâ€™t have to worry about different currencies or anything like that. Just use stablecoins (digital dollars) to send value.

Itâ€™s so easy to get started, you donâ€™t even need to write code!

Letâ€™s get started!!!
