# Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you’ve created your Business Wallet and Business Card account.
We recommend using a Business Card on the Polygon Network—it’s much cheaper for you and your team.

Let’s walk you through what this process looks like.

## Access Business Wallet

From your Personal Wallet side, hold down (long press) the profile icon until you see a pop-up. It will show you all the wallets you can access.

- If you already have a Business Wallet, you’ll see "Business Wallet"
- If you don’t, you’ll see "Open Business Wallet"

If it’s the latter, please create a Business Wallet before proceeding.

### Creating a Business Card

Once you’ve created a Business Wallet, swipe through the cards on your Wallet tab until you find "Business Card", then click it. You should see a pop-up similar to the one below:

<div
style="display: flex;">

  alt="Create wallet" width="300"  
  height="200">
  <img
  src="/images/IMG_3310.PNG"  
  alt="Restore wallet" width="300"  
  height="200">
</div>

Select Ethereum or Polygon, depending on which Business Card you want to open. Next, you’ll see a page like the one below:

<div
style="display: flex;">
  <img

  alt="Create wallet" width="300"  
  height="200">
  <img
  src="/images/IMG_3312.PNG"  
  alt="Restore wallet" width="300"  
  height="200">
</div>

#### Pension

The Pension is a percentage deducted from employees' (not executives') periodic payments. This amount remains in your Business Card Wallet until you decide to send it to them—either upon their retirement or when they leave the business.

This option is not mandatory and can be skipped.

Proceed with performing 2FA and entering your PIN. Once your wallet has been created, you’re ready to move forward!
